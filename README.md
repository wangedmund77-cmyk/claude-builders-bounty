## Destructive Bash Guard Hook

This PR includes a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook for bounty [#3](../../issues/3).

Install it from the repository root:

```bash
python3 hooks/destructive-bash-guard/destructive_bash_guard.py --install
```

Run the bundled smoke samples:

```bash
python3 hooks/destructive-bash-guard/destructive_bash_guard.py < hooks/destructive-bash-guard/samples/safe-input.json
python3 hooks/destructive-bash-guard/destructive_bash_guard.py < hooks/destructive-bash-guard/samples/dangerous-input.json
```

The safe sample exits cleanly; the dangerous sample returns a structured
`PreToolUse` deny decision, explains the block, and writes to
`~/.claude/hooks/blocked.log`.
Non-empty malformed hook payloads also fail closed and are logged as
`<invalid hook payload>`.
The audit log path is kept user-only and symlinked log paths are refused.
The guard also blocks common reverse-shell launch patterns, including
`/dev/tcp` interactive shells, netcat exec shells, socat exec shells, and
Python socket/`dup2` shells.
