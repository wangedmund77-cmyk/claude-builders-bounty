## Next.js SQLite SaaS CLAUDE.md Template

This PR includes a production-minded `CLAUDE.md` template for bounty [#2](../../issues/2).

Copy it into a greenfield Next.js 15 App Router + SQLite SaaS project:

```bash
cp templates/nextjs-sqlite-saas/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

The template covers stack/version choices, project structure, naming conventions, dev commands, CI gates, SQLite migrations, data access, App Router patterns, testing expectations, and anti-patterns. Smoke-test notes are included at `templates/nextjs-sqlite-saas/GREENFIELD_TEST_NOTES.md`.

Validate the template signals:

```bash
python3 templates/nextjs-sqlite-saas/validate_template.py
```
